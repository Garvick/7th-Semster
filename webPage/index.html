                When I was 22 buying first car my roommate took me to see the lemon lot(cars that need to
                be sold fast). Disappointed that I could not find one that was in buying range I tell my roommate I 
                would not be buying any because they were out of my price range. My roommate pointing back 
                says he would sell me his blue one in my price range. My first question what is it? Coming into 
                work my coworkers comment on my new car as if I was balling. Confused because I did not 
                understand the premise of BMW.

                    One night spring of 2022 at 1 in the morning a sudden burst of gunshots were heard on the street to the right of my house. After the gunshots are heard my roomate runs out the front 
                    door catching sight of the car at the corner right before it speeds off. My roomate comes to me talking about how a black scion did it. It hit me I not had no idea 
                    what a scion looks like I do not reconize the logo only the name of the brand. That is why I Decided to make this website to provide basic knowledge of common cars 
                    found in the United States.
