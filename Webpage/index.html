                When I was 22 buying first car my roommate took me to see the lemon lot(cars that need to
                be sold fast). Disappointed that I could not find one that was in buying range I tell my roommate I 
                would not be buying any because they were out of my price range. My roommate pointing back 
                says he would sell me his blue one in my price range. My first question what is it? Coming into 
                work my coworkers comment on my new car as if I was balling. Confused because I did not 
                understand the premise of BMW.

                    With a story of a shooting that happened on my street. 
                    With an explanation on why at least knowing the brands of cars is an important factor when
                    it is a crucial competent of identifying a person. Explaining why I decided to choose the topic to 
                    create the page.
